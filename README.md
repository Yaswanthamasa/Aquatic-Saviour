![Water Pollution](https://repurpose.global/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Untitled-design-40.png)

- The millions and tons of plastics swirling around oceans have garnered a lot of attention recently. Plastic poses bigger threat to all life.
- Not only plastics there also many more pollutants in water bodies and lot of sea life is dying because of the water pollution.
- The most visible impacts of plastic debris are the ingestion, suffocation and entanglement of hundreds of marine species.
- Marine wildlife such as seabirds, whales, fish and turtles mistake plastic waste for prey; most then **die of starvation as their stomachs become filled with plastic**.
- Generally when the pollutants when  gets into the system of the prey animals, the pollutants gets transferred from the prey animal to an predator animal across whole food chain until the apex predator, resulting in higher concentrations of pollutants compared with the source which is called as **Biomagnification**.
- The effect of Biomagnification is  widely believed to be a general phenomenon for marine food webs and this have a potential of becoming a catastrophy on human life too .

# Aquatic Saviour
- If all the water people drink gets polluted, what will humans and other animals have to drink? Water pollution is bad for the environment, animals and people, and it is dwindling the small supply of freshwater on earth. Water is needed for many reasons, especially the environment.
- Considering all the above problems were are designing this <strong>Aquatic Saviour</strong> game.
- Right after opening our game you will see our Main Menu. When we click on PlayGame we will be taken to Backstory of the game.
- When we get into Story scene we can skip to playing the game.
- The player in the game must collect garbage and vaccinates the fish with a vaccinated gas showing it's effect in water for score.
- He must avoid colliding with rusty ship anchors and Mines. Once he gets collided the game gets over
- The score will be given based on the fish he save and the plastic amount he collects.
- The game **Aquatic Saviour** is strictly a morality-crisis game and focuses more on passing an awareness and showing the possible danger in the future in a very strong manner unlike many other games that focuses more on violence.

### Backstory of the game in brief

The player in the the very near future loses the people he care about to water pollution and commits to accomplish a painful task which is cleaning all the water in the world and vaccinating the fish in the process to avoid the Biomagnification. From here is what the game starts and the it is upto the person who controls the game to make sure how good he completes the task.
